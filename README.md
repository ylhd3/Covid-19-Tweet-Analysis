# Covid-19 Tweet/X Analysis
This repository contains the analysis I conducted on Covid-19 social media posts, as well as the resulting graphs produced from the data analysis.\
\
This was a fairly basic method of data processing, as during this project. That, combined with a fairly small data set, resulted in the entire analysis to be inconclusive.\
\
If I had more time, and tools, I would like to have pulled posts from the entire day in a specified location, rather than a mere 100, and tested different methods of data processing, including testing various machine learning algorithm for the analysis.
